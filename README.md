## What is Libertatis?
Libertatis is a revolutionary decentralized finance project built on the Ethereum blockchain. We're not just another crypto token; we're a multifaceted ecosystem with a focus on secure, high-yield financial services. Driven by the Financial Independence, Retire Early (F.I.R.E) movement, Libertatis aims to democratize finance, making it accessible and rewarding for everyone.

## Why Libertatis?
Why should you be part of this? Because we're pioneering the first-ever public minting in crypto history, offering unparalleled Annual Percentage Yields (APYs), and building a platform that stands for financial empowerment and security. In other words, we're here to redefine what DeFi can be, and we want you to be a part of this journey.

## Safety First
We understand that the crypto space can be fraught with uncertainties. That's why safety isn't just a feature; it's our core principle.
- No tokens for the team before launch; we buy with our own money post-launch.
- Rug pull and whale protection are hard-coded into our immutable smart contracts.
- Our project has received top-notch security ratings, thanks to rigorous audits and scans by de.fi and solidityscan.com.
- We're pioneering the first public minting in crypto history, ensuring fairness and accessibility for all.
